# POLYMER FEATURIZATION
This repository contains data and code demonstrating the implementation of various featurization strategies for machine learning of polymers.

Many of the featurization strategies are discussed and compared in the following article:

# Dataset A
This compiles numerous physical properties for 2,585 intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) obtained by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation. The dataset was generated as part of Ref. 1. The specific IDP sequences are sourced from version 9.0 of the DisProt database. The simulations were performed using the LAMMPS molecular dynamics engine.
